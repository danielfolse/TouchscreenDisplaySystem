# TouchscreenDisplaySystem
SFWE 301 Project
This Project was a joint project between myself Daniel Folse and Adam Hoffmeister
We set out to create a touchscreen display system for the Software Engineering Program's use.
They had purhcased a touchscreen display to be an interactive system for us to work with.
Below is the constraints of the assignment:
Basic Overview:
The Software Engineering team recently purchased a 43” Samsung QM43R-T Touch-Screen Display
mounted on the wall outside the Software Engineering advisor’s office (located near ENGR 255). The
objective of getting the touch screen monitor to provide an interactive way for students to get
information about the new Software Engineering degree program. We wanted to provide them with a
way to learn about the different ways students could get involved and learn more about software
engineering that they will be going into (clubs, internships, program requirements, etc.). When students
are waiting in the hallway to meet with a faculty member or advisor, they can interact with the screen
and gain some additional insight into their own field.
The touch screen display has its own computer that controls the content that is displayed. The
computer sites in the academic advisor’s office.
This project includes discovering/eliciting the software requirements for controlling the display contents,
displaying the information on the touch screen as described below, and allowing users to interact with
the content displayed on the touch screen monitor.
User Desires for Touch Screen Functionality:
 A homepage with different “widgets”/tiles to explore that can be interacted with via user’s
touch
